# Responsive HTML & CSS Project

This project contains two files:

- **index.html** → Holds the structure of the webpage.  
- **style.css** → Adds styling, layout, and responsiveness.  

## How It Works

### index.html
- Uses **HTML5 semantic tags** like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.  
- The **header** has navigation links.  
- The **hero section** shows the title and a call-to-action button.  
- The **projects section** displays items in a grid.  
- The **footer** shows copyright text and links.  

### style.css
- Uses **Flexbox** to align items in the header and footer.  
- Uses **CSS Grid** to arrange project cards.  
- Adds **colors, padding, and hover effects** for design.  
- Includes **media queries** so the layout changes on smaller screens (tablet and mobile).  

## Running the Project
1. Keep both `index.html` and `style.css` in the same folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Resize the browser window to see the responsive design in action.
